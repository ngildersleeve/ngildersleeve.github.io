# 👋 Hi, I'm Nate Gildersleeve

I'm a mathematician-turned-machine learning practitioner with 10+ years of experience in education, problem-solving, and technical communication. I’m currently building my portfolio in data science and AI with projects focused on predictive modeling, computer vision, and automation.

### 🔭 Current Focus
- Machine learning (classification, regression, deep learning)
- Model deployment and automation
- SQL and BI tools for data analysis
- Bridging math, code, and communication for real-world impact

## 💼 Projects

Here are a few selected projects that show how I think, build, and learn. Each one includes a description, tools used, and what I learned or contributed.

### 📊 [Used Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/ngildersleeve/used-cars-regression/tree/main)
Cleaned and explored a dataset of used cars in India, then built regression and decision tree models to predict prices.

**Skills:** pandas, matplotlib, regression, scikit-learn, model evaluation
